Fast Financial Information Exchange (FIX) protocol parser [FFP]

Fast Fix Parser (FFP) is a library which converts chunks of data (raw bytes) 
as they arrive from e.g. a socket, into a representation of FIX messages that 
can be further analysed for semantic checks, converted into “business” structures, etc. 
It also provides a way to specify what tags are allowed for a particular message and 
verifies this specification at run-time.
